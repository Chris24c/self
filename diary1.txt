So back to this because I feel like it'll help me in my future as third year is gonna be hard for a multitude of reasons.
I think my last entry was just before last christmas(2016).
I had been planning on making things work with Lorraine, it was all I wanted at the time. It didnt work out at the time unfortunately, and all was rough for a while. It is now 28th of September and yesterday on the 27th of september, after a few dates, I asked Lorraine to be my girlfriend and she said yes.
So thats definitely a good thing, I just need to see it that way, but im having trouble with it.
There are definite incompatibilities between us, such as differing levels of intimacy, I like cuddling and holding hands, she doesnt really.
Sometimes I feel a kind of disconnect between us when im with her, like my consciousness is barely floating at the surface and im not really there. I also feel like sometimes she can be kind of flat out hurtful to me.
Saying things I like in relationships are "gay" or "cringy" whereas to me its just normal relationshippy stuff that I like. Its also very very hard to criticise her in any way.
So
Lets deal with this stuff.
Marie and Wayne have survived 5 years of a relationship where theres an even bigger gap in intimacy so that gives me hope that it can be overcome.
I need to become a better listener.
Call her out on her bullshit when she says hurtful stuff and let her know its hurtful.
It should get easier with time to hash things out with her.
I need to remember the good things about her, like her kindness and her smile. How she is always willing to pick me up when I feel like shit.
she is incredibly good at picking up when I feel bad. 
I really need to find a way to stop getting upset over small things.
